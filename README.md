## 🖥 the product under test

A small task-management SPA in `app/` — dependency-free vanilla JS,
~200 lines, no build step. Four states (todo / in_progress / done),
five tags, a drawer for create + edit, a debounced search box, a toast
on save. The same product is tested three different ways across this
repo.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/img/spa-hero.png" width="900" alt="TaskFlow SPA — four task cards, status pills, tags" />
</div>

The SPA is intentionally boring. The interesting part isn't the app —
it's how the tests around it are written.

## 🎯 a real assertion failing loudly

The SPA wraps `loadTasks` in a 300 ms debounce. The badge in the corner
counts every `GET /api/tasks` the page makes. Five keystrokes in 200 ms
— **the counter goes ×0 → ×1**. Anything else would be a regression in
the debounce, and the test would fail with the exact number it saw.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/img/demo-search-debounce.gif" width="900" alt="Search debounce — 5 chars typed, 1 request fired" />
</div>

```python
assert len(mock.requests) == 1, (
    f"debounce should coalesce 5 keystrokes into 1 GET, "
    f"got {len(mock.requests)}: {[r.url for r in mock.requests]}"
)
```

If this ever broke on a feature branch, the failure would read:

```
AssertionError: debounce should coalesce 5 keystrokes into 1 GET,
got 3: ['…/api/tasks?q=a', '…/api/tasks?q=alp', '…/api/tasks?q=alpha']
```

That's a diagnosis. "test failed" is not.

→ More on this in [**TESTING.md**](TESTING.md) and [**ADR 002 — mock requests are counted on exit**](docs/adr/0002-mock-count-on-exit.md).

---

## 🚫 validation that doesn't trust the SUT

The drawer rejects three flavours of bad title client-side — empty,
whitespace-only, too short. The parametrized test runs all three with
their own AllureIDs (B-401 / B-402 / B-403) so the rows stay traceable
in the report.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/img/demo-validation.gif" width="900" alt="Validation — three invalid titles rejected with their own messages" />
</div>

Every case asserts not just that an error appeared, but that **no POST
was sent** — `create_mock.requests == []`. A client-side reject that
silently fires the request is the worst kind of false-pass.

The SPA in `app/` is the same in every case. What changes is the test
side.

## ⚖️ same test, two stacks

The single strongest piece of evidence in this repo: the **same**
assertion — "the SPA's 300 ms debounce coalesces 5 keystrokes into one
backend call" — written in both styles.

<table>

```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Same product. Same assertion. Different texture. **That's the point.**
Both are correct; one fits a 10-test side project, the other fits a
1000-test suite with five QAs reading each other's code.

## 🔌 api/ fixture chain

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/img/diagram-fixture-chain.svg" alt="API fixture chain — http_session → auth_token → auth_session → api_manager → clean_tasks" />
</div>

`auth_token` is `scope="session"` because POST /login is ~200 ms — 100
tests at function-scope would burn 20 sec doing nothing useful.
`clean_tasks` is per-function because state isolation between tests is
non-negotiable. **Picking the scope is the whole engineering exercise.**

→ [**ADR 005 — fixture scopes are picked, not defaulted**](docs/adr/0005-fixture-scopes-picked.md).

## 🧩 when each stack pays off

|                       | ui-pytest (pytest + POM)            | ui-vedro (vedro + d42)                              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Best fit              | <300 tests, 1–3 QA                  | 1000+ tests, 5+ QA                                  |
| Onboarding cost       | low                                 | higher, pays back at scale                          |
| Locators              | `data-test` (or CSS/xpath if it fits) | `data-test` only — CSS/xpath forbidden by convention |
| Mocks                 | per-test `page.route()` helpers     | typed `MockedRoute`, `history`, strict count check  |
| API contracts in UI   | dict literals, `fake_*` helpers     | d42 schemas (`fake(Schema % {...})`)                |
| Allure labels         | `@allure.feature/.story` direct     | typed catalog, order enforced by decorator          |
| Iteration speed       | fast                                | slower per test, more guarantees per test           |
| Reading group         | familiar to any pytest user         | familiar to teams on the vedro stack                |

Neither is "better". `ui-pytest` is what I'd reach for on a smaller
team. `ui-vedro` earns its weight once contract-shaped pain starts
showing up in fixtures.

## 🧪 what this repo demonstrates

- **UI automation** — Playwright (sync + async), Page Object Model, data-test locators, debounce verification, error-recovery flows
- **API automation** — pytest + requests + facade pattern (`ApiManager`), session/class/function fixture scopes, JWT auth, CRUD + filters + validation
- **Mocking** — Playwright `route()` interception (per-test + reusable helpers), typed `RecordedRequest` with strict count assertions
- **Contracts** — d42 schemas with source-cited bounds (HTML attr / regex / API), reused across mocks and assertions
- **Reporting** — Allure, GitHub Pages publishing, typed label catalog, parametrized scenarios with unique TMS ids
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions matrix, hermetic test runs, artifact upload, combined Pages deploy on main, branded landing page
- **Backend** — FastAPI service with JWT + Pydantic validation (just enough to back the API suite)
- **Documentation** — ADRs, philosophy doc, contributing guide, issue/PR templates, changelog

## 🚀 running locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt \
            -r api/requirements.txt \
            -r ui-pytest/requirements.txt
pip install -e ui-vedro
playwright install chromium

# api suite needs the backend up
( cd backend && uvicorn main:app --port 8000 ) &

cd api        && pytest -v
cd ui-pytest  && pytest -v
cd ui-vedro   && make test
```

The SPA in `app/` is plain static files. UI suites boot
`python -m http.server` against it; the FastAPI in `backend/` is only
there for the API suite.

## 📖 reading guide

If you have 5 minutes, in this order:

1. `ui-vedro/scenarios/board/search_input_debounces_keystrokes.py` —
   typing 5 chars in 200 ms and asserting the backend was hit exactly once.
2. `ui-vedro/mocks/mocked_route.py` — the typed mock layer with strict
   count check on exit.
3. `ui-vedro/schemas/__init__.py` — every constraint cites where the bound came from.
4. `api/conftest.py` — the fixture chain with scope decisions annotated.
5. `api/custom_requester/custom_requester.py` — the base class every API client extends.

If you have 30 minutes:

- Open the [live Allure report](https://nightmarovvv.github.io/qa-automation-portfolio/report/).
- Skim [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
- Read the [ADR series](docs/adr/) in order.
